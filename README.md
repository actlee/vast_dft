# Description
This is a **MATLAB** code repository for the manuscript below.

***Taewoong Lee, Liming Shi, Jesper Kjær Nielsen, and Mads Græsbøll Christensen***, ''Fast Generation of Sound Zones Using Variable Span Trade-Off Filters in the DFT-Domain,'' *IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing*, Nov. 2020, accepted for publication.

## Note
Since the room impulse responses (RIRs) used in the manuscript is not able to be shared, simulated RIRs are used to reproduce the results described in the manuscript. Therefore, the results are similar but different from those in the manuscript.

The simulated RIRs were generated by using `rir_generator`, which can be downloaded from the following links:
